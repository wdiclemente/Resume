%\section{OBJECTIVE}          
%    A summer teaching position that relates to my physics background.          
 

\section{PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY}
    I recently received my PhD in experimental particle physics, and I am seeking employment in the data science or tech industries.
    I have nearly 10 years of research experience with the ATLAS experiment at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, during which I have learned how to write my own software as well as use existing frameworks to analyze large volumes of particle collision data.
    I really enjoy the problem-solving aspect of taking a huge amount of information and extracting something useful from it.

   ATLAS is one of the particle detector experiments at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland. 
   It is one of the largest scientific collaborations ever, consisting of over 3000 scientists stationed around the world and on-site at CERN.
   Projects typically are collaborative with a team of scientists working in parallel to complete the study.
   Research involves using ATLAS's data analysis framework as well as writing personal or project-specific analysis software to process the large volumes of data collected by the detector.

   Nearly 10 years of research experience including physics measurements and detector performance studies.
   \begin{itemize}
     \item {\it Physics analysis} (2011-2013, 2015-2019): Analysis of LHC collision data to identify and measure particle interactions, such as electroweak boson scattering, and compare to theoretical predictions.
           Wrote analysis software to select candidate signal events passing specific criteria and compare to simulated data and models of relevant background processes in order to measure the physics process of interest.
           PhD thesis highlights: modeling of the non-prompt lepton background---one that is difficult to accurately predict via Monte Carlo simulations---and optimization of the signal event selection using a modified grid scan technique.
     \item {\it Detector performance} (2014-2019): High measurement accuracy is essential for precise physics measurements and is maintained through studies of ATLAS's performance.
           Worked with a team to correct physical movements of detector sensors that can occur during normal operation by deriving and applying software-level corrections to the data.
   \end{itemize}
