    {\bf $\boldsymbol{W}$ Boson Analysis and Detector Alignment with the CERN ATLAS Experiment}\\
    University of Pennsylvania (2014-2019)/Duke University (2010-2013)\\
    {\it Particle Physics Researcher}

    ATLAS's first observation of same-sign $W$ boson scattering using 2015-2016 data:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Modified existing method for modeling background contribution from fake leptons by including more measured quantities in order to achieve better data-simulation agreement
    \item Developed new method using 2D cuts targeting 3-lepton backgrounds, reducing them by up to 20\% in some tests
    \end{itemize}
    Prospects for same-sign $W$ boson scattering at future HL-LHC collider:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Increased signal significance by nearly 60\% by optimizing selection using a random grid search algorithm
    \item Corrected overprediction of top quark backgrounds by implementing an analogue for a particle isolation requirement missing from the simulation
    \end{itemize}
    Alignment of the ATLAS Inner Detector:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Corrected misaligned sensors by applying corrections derived using a global $\chi^2$ minimization of track-hit residuals from millions of particle tracks
    \item Measured and corrected momentum biases in the detector using 2D maps created from fits of electron energy and momentum distributions
    \end{itemize}

    %Measured same-sign $W$ boson scattering cross section with 2015-2016 ATLAS data.
   %Modified existing method for modeling background contribution from fake leptons to achieve better data-simulation agreement.
   %Developed new method for reducing 3-lepton backgrounds via 2D cuts, tests showed up to 20\% additional background rejection.
   %Analyzed prospects for same analysis at future HL-LHC collider.
   %Increased signal significance by nearly 60\% by optimizing selection using a random grid search algorithm, and corrected overpredicted top quark backgrounds by implementing an analogue for a particle isolation requirement missing from the simulation.
   %Corrected for misaligned detector sensors by applying corrections during data reconstruction derived using a global $\chi^2$ minimization of track-hit residuals from millions of particle tracks.

%   ATLAS is one of the particle detector experiments at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland. 
%   It is one of the largest scientific collaborations ever, consisting of over 3000 scientists stationed around the world and at CERN.
%   
%   Nearly ten years of research experience as a graduate and undergraduate student including physics measurements and detector performance studies.
%   Projects typically are collaborative with a team of scientists working in parallel to complete the study.
%   Research involves using ATLAS's data analysis framework as well as writing personal or project-specific analysis software to process the large volumes of data collected by the detector.
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item {\it Physics analysis} (2011-2013, 2015-2019): Analysis of LHC collision data to identify and measure particle interactions, such as electroweak boson scattering, and compare to theoretical predictions.
%           Candidate events passing specific signal criteria are selected and various background processes are modeled in order to measure the process of interest.
%     \item {\it Detector performance} (2014-2019): High measurement quality is essential for precise physics measurements and is maintained through studies of ATLAS's performance.
%           Physical movements of detector sensors that can occur during normal operation are accounted for by deriving and applying corrections at software-level when data is processed.

%   Taught the laboratory component of the undergraduate introductory physics courses for classical mechanics and electricity and magnetism across three semesters.
%   Responsibilities included lab demos and guidance, teaching necessary content if not covered in lecture, and lab report grading.
