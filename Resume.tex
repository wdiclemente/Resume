\section{RESEARCH EXPERIENCE}%\vspace{-10pt}
    {\bf Particle Physics Research with the ATLAS Experiment at CERN}\\
    University of Pennsylvania (2014-2019)/Duke University (2010-2013)

    As a physics researcher, I used a combination of C++ and Python software including ROOT, experiment-wide frameworks, and personal analysis-specific software to read, analyze, and visualize terabytes of real and simulated ATLAS data.
    My research was highly collaborative; our analysis teams would regularly report progress with parent groups, interact with experts on detector performance, and consult with theorists for additional ideas and models to test.
    
    % large data set -- terabytes (petabytes) in size
    % existing analysis frameworks in C++ and python
    % write own code in C++ and python, analyze/visualize with ROOT
    % problem solving -> top background too high, update fake factor, etc
    % leading role in WW upgrade, leading in fake factor method
    % Collaborative, worked in analysis group and performance group (talk to other analyzers within or outside of your group, performance people, theorists)

    {\bf Research highlights} include:
    \begin{itemize}
    %\item Played a leading role in an analysis using simulated data for a proposed future collider experiment.
    \item Played a leading role in the development of an updated technique for modeling troublesome background processes in a high-profile physics analysis.
    \item Slimmed and skimmed many-terabyte datasets into smaller, analysis-specific samples for several different analyses.
    \item Optimized an analysis's signal selection using a random grid search algorithm, improving the significance by nearly 60\%.
    \item Introduced a new set of 2D cuts to an analysis which reduced a major background by 20\%.
    \item Monitored detector performance for possible biases in data reconstruction using 2D maps built from fits to distributions of various measured quantities.
    \item Analysis work resulted in 4 papers, as well as being a contributing author on over 100 additional ATLAS publications.
    \end{itemize}

\section{TEACHING EXPERIENCE}%\vspace{-10pt}
    {\bf Introductory Physics Laboratory Teaching Assistant}\\
    University of Pennsylvania (2013-2014)

    Taught three semesters of classical mechanics and electricity and magnetism labs. Responsibilities included demonstrating lab techniques, guiding students through their exercises, teaching supplemental material, and grading lab reports.

%%%%%
%   ATLAS is one of the particle detector experiments at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland. 
%   It is one of the largest scientific collaborations ever, consisting of over 3000 scientists stationed around the world and at CERN.
%   
%   Nearly ten years of research experience as a graduate and undergraduate student including physics measurements and detector performance studies.
%   Projects typically are collaborative with a team of scientists working in parallel to complete the study.
%   Research involves using ATLAS's data analysis framework as well as writing personal or project-specific analysis software to process the large volumes of data collected by the detector.
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item {\it Physics analysis} (2011-2013, 2015-2019): Analysis of LHC collision data to identify and measure particle interactions, such as electroweak boson scattering, and compare to theoretical predictions.
%           Candidate events passing specific signal criteria are selected and various background processes are modeled in order to measure the process of interest.
%     \item {\it Detector performance} (2014-2019): High measurement quality is essential for precise physics measurements and is maintained through studies of ATLAS's performance.
%           Physical movements of detector sensors that can occur during normal operation are accounted for by deriving and applying corrections at software-level when data is processed.
