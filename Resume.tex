   Physics research with the ATLAS Collaboration at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) as a graduate and undergraduate student.
   Research involves using and writing analysis software to read through the large volumes of data collected by the experiment.
   \begin{itemize}
     \item Physics analysis (2011-2013, 2015-2019): Analysis of LHC data to identify and measure particular particle interactions and compare to theoretical predictions.
     \item Detector performance (2014-2019): Maintain high measurement quality by deriving and applying software-level corrections to account for physical movements of detector elements.
   \end{itemize}
